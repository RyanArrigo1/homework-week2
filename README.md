# homework-week2

I appologize for not finishing but I was working on adding styling to my portfolio by sectioning off past projects i have completed below the about me section. My goal was to create sections out of my completed work that, when hovered over explained what they were. I also wanted to clean up my links but I just did not have the time this past week.
