        <div class="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Florida, I was fortunate enough to be a member 
            of the 'Young Eagles' program, co-piloting small aircraft.  
            I was also a team member racing high performance one-design 
            sailboats in local venues. As a  junior hockey player I traveled 
            around the United States playing in the northeast and Canada. 
            My faith is also very important to me. I am seeking to find a 
            good balance between classroom and work. I am a dedicated, hardworking 
            team player who firmly believes that success is achievable regardless 
            of circumstances . Ideally I would like to be at a program where I 
            would be able to make a significant contribution both in and outside 
            the workplace.

                    <h4>The Produce Wizard</h4>
                    <p>The Produce Wizard works by slowing down the ripening process of fruits and vegetables. For example tomatoes and bananas excrete a gas called ethylene which makes them ripen quickly. With the revolutionary technology built into the produce Wizard, it can slow down the ripening process of bananas to 21 days and tomatoes down to 30 days. The Produce Wizard provides consumers with an expertly engineered appliance to keep your produce fresher. We leverage our knowledge of produce to reduce risk of disease and spoilage.</p>

                    <p>There are two fundamental analyses that an agent does. She looks at the housing market overall. She also looks at the house, from the neighborhood that surrounds it right down to quality and origin of the kitchen appliances. This is where the agent adds value.

                        Good agents have their own algorithms, and the best can be exceptionally accurate. Good agents know which data is important, which data really translates into information they and their clients can use. Then they take that information and guide their clients through the best decision. Maybe they donâ€™t take into account 200 different factors, but our models are strong because they take into account accurate and applicable local data.

                    <h4>Trading Algo</h4>
                    <p>Algorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using automated pre-programmed trading instructions accounting for variables such as time, price, and volume. This type of trading attempts to leverage the speed and computational resources of computers relative to human traders. In the twenty-first century, algorithmic trading has been gaining traction with both retail and institutional traders. It is widely used by investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds that may need to spread out the execution of a larger order or perform trades too fast for human traders to react to. A study in 2019 showed that around 92% of trading in the Forex market was performed by trading algorithms rather than humans.

                        The term algorithmic trading is often used synonymously with automated trading system. These encompass a variety of trading strategies, some of which are based on formulas and results from mathematical finance, and often rely on specialized software.
